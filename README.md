# R.toruloides
Rhodutorula toruloides (former Rhodosporidium toruloides) is a natural producer of industrially important compounds, such as carotenoids, lipids, and enzymes with potential uses in pharma and chemical industries. This yeast is also capable of using a wide range of carbon and nitrogen sources, exhibits a high tolerance to inhibitors present in unrefined substrates, and can grow to high cell densities. Therefore, R. toruloides has a high potential to become a valuable workhorse for the production of a large variety of high-value molecules, especially from the low-cost substrates (Park et al., 2017).  There is a lack of a reliable genetic manipulation tool for this yeast. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop methods for modular cloning (i.e., Golden Gate platform) and genome editing of R. toruloides ― like CRISPR/Cas9 system ― to make this promising yeast strain compatible chassis to be applied in industrial processes.
